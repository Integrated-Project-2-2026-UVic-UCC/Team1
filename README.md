<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## 📖 Introduction

Nowadays, robots are gaining relevance due to their capacity to simulate and improve complex tasks. Significant effort is currently being directed toward **self-learning capabilities** in autonomous systems.

Our proposal is the design and creation of a **Quadrupedal Robot controlled via Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. The goal is to simulate canine behavior and optimize locomotion through trial and error, stepping out of our comfort zone to tackle new challenges.

> **The Team:** We are a group of four students experienced in different areas of **mechatronics** and robotics competitions.

<!-- OBJECTIVES SECTION (Grid Layout) -->
## 🎯 Objectives

The main objective is to **design, build, and train** a quadrupedal robot capable of autonomous locomotion using AI agents.

### Specific Goals

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🔋 **Autonomy** | Transformer alimentation for continous power supply during operation. |
| ⚖️ **Balance** | Robust dynamic balance control to handle uneven surfaces. |
| 📦 **Design** | Compact, lightweight, yet structurally sound mechanical design. |
| 🛡️ **Durability** | High robustness to withstand the physical stress of learning (falling and recovering). |
