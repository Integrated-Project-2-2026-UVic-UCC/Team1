<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## 📖 Introduction

Nowadays, robots are gaining relevance due to their capacity to simulate and improve complex tasks. Significant effort is currently being directed toward **self-learning capabilities** in autonomous systems.

Our proposal is the design and creation of a **Quadrupedal Robot controlled via Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. The goal is to simulate canine behavior and optimize locomotion through trial and error, stepping out of our comfort zone to tackle new challenges.

> **The Team:** We are a group of four students experienced in different areas of **mechatronics** and robotics competitions.

<!-- OBJECTIVES SECTION (Grid Layout) -->
## 🎯 Objectives

The main objective is to **design, build, and train** a quadrupedal robot capable of autonomous locomotion using AI agents.

### Specific Goals

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🔋 **Autonomy** | Battery life optimized for comfortable use and extended testing sessions. |
| ⚖️ **Balance** | Robust dynamic balance control to handle uneven surfaces. |
| 🌊 **Fluency** | Smooth, natural gait generation similar to biological counterparts. |
| 📦 **Design** | Compact, lightweight, yet structurally sound mechanical design. |
| 🛡️ **Durability** | High robustness to withstand the physical stress of learning (falling and recovering). |

<!-- FOLDER STRUCTURE (The Core) -->
## 📂 Repository Structure

This project follows a multidisciplinary approach, divided into three main pillars:

<div align="center">

### 1. 🛠️ Mechanics
**`./Mechanics`**
</div>

> Contains all the hardware design files necessary to build the physical robot.
> *   **CAD Models:** SolidWorks/Fusion360 source files.
> *   **3D Printing:** `.STL` files ready for slicing.
> *   **Simulation:** URDF/Meshes for simulation environments (Gazebo/PyBullet).

<br>

<div align="center">

### 2. ⚡ Electronics
**`./Electronics`**
</div>

> Houses the nervous system of the robot.
> *   **Schematics:** Wiring diagrams and connection maps.
> *   **PCB Design:** EasyEDA files for custom boards.
> *   **BOM:** Bill of Materials (Sensors, Actuators, Microcontrollers, Batteries).

<br>

<div align="center">

### 3. 💻 Software
**`./Software`**
</div>

> The brain of the project, split into low-level control and high-level AI.
> *   **Firmware:** Code for the microcontrollers (motor drivers, IMU data reading).
> *   **Reinforcement Learning:** MuJoCo training environments, generated control models.
> *   **Control:** ROS2 control packeges, inverse kinematics and gait planning algorithms.
